# Schulcloud Notification-API

> feathers app to provide the schulcloud notification api

## About

This app will be the central notification service of the schulcloud project. 

As API framework, we use [Feathers](http://feathersjs.com). 

## Getting Started

1. Make sure you have [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) and [mongodb](https://www.mongodb.com/) installed.

2. Install your dependencies

    ```
    cd path/to/node-notification-service; npm install
    ```

3. If not already done, start mongodb (`mongod`)

4. Start your app

    ```
    npm start
    ```

## Testing

Simply run `npm test` and all your tests in the `test/` directory will be run.

## Scaffolding

Feathers has a powerful command line interface. Here are a few things it can do:

```
$ npm install -g feathers-cli             # Install Feathers CLI

$ feathers generate service               # Generate a new Service
$ feathers generate hook                  # Generate a new Hook
$ feathers generate model                 # Generate a new Model
$ feathers help                           # Show all commands
```
